#  Import Global Poker Hands Into Poker Tracker 4 in Minutes 

The poker world is always buzzing with the latest news and gossip. Whether it's a new, hot site that's appeared on the scene or a player winning big at the WSOP, there's always something happening in the poker world.

One of the perennial issues for poker players is staying on top of all the latest news. You don't want to be the one left out of the loop talking about last week's hands when everyone else is up to speed on what's going on this week.

Luckily, there are a few ways to stay on top of things. For starters, most major online poker sites offer live updates of current games as they happen. You can also follow pro players and other notable figures in the poker world on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook for real-time news.

But arguably one of the best ways to keep tabs on what's happening in poker is to use tracking software like Poker Tracker 4. This software allows you to track your own progress as well as keep tabs on how your opponents are playing.

But one thing that PT4 doesn't offer is a way to import global hands into the software. This can be a bit of a hassle if you're trying to track how a particular opponent is playing, as you have to search through various different sites and hand databases to find those particular hands.

But luckily there's an easy workaround - using a tool called HHGenius. HHGenius is a free online tool that allows you to quickly and easily import global poker hands into Poker Tracker 4.

Here's how it works:
