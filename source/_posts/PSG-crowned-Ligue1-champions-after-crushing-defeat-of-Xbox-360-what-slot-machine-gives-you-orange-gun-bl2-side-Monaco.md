#  PSG crowned Ligue1 champions after crushing defeat of Xbox 360 what slot machine gives you orange gun bl2 side Monaco

Paris Saint-Germain were crowned Ligue1 champions after a crushing 5-0 victory over relegation-threatened Monaco.

The result puts the French capital side out of reach with five games to play, as Neymar starred with a goal and two assists.

Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani also got on the scoresheet, as Unai Emery's men made it back-to-back titles in France.

PSG were always in control of this one, dominating possession and chances right from the start.

Neymar had already come close to opening the scoring before finally breaking the deadlock in the 25th minute, curling home a sumptuous free-kick into the top corner.

Mbappe then made it 2-0 five minutes later, latching onto Neymar's through ball before coolly slotting past Danijel Subasic.

Cavani then got in on the act just after halftime, tapping home from close range after being played in by Dani Alves.

Neymar then grabbed his second assist of the game just after the hour mark, setting up Mbappe for an easy finish to make it 4-0.

Cavani then completed the rout in injury time, smashing home from long range to seal an emphatic win and PSG's sixth Ligue1 title in seven years.

#  Neymar stars as PSG clinch league title with demolition of Monaco

Paris Saint-Germain clinched the Ligue 1 title in style on Sunday with a 6-1 demolition of Monaco at the Parc des Princes.

Neymar shone for the home side, scoring twice and setting up another two goals as PSG ended the season with an astonishing 93 points from 38 games.

The victory also meant that Unai Emery's team became the first club in Europe's top five leagues to win all their domestic league matches in a season.

Edinson Cavani and Kylian Mbappe also got on the scoresheet for PSG, while Radamel Falcao grabbed a consolation goal for Monaco in injury time.

Neymar opened the scoring in familiar fashion, curling a free-kick into the top corner in the ninth minute before setting up Cavani for PSG's second goal just after the half-hour mark.

Mbappe then got in on the act himself with a superb solo run and finish early in the second half, making it 4-0 to PSG and effectively ending Monaco's challenge. Neymar then completed his brace with an easy finish from close range after being set up by Angel Di Maria.

Falcao did pull one back for Monaco late on, but it was mere consolation as PSG cruised to an emphatic victory which sealed their seventh league title.

#  Monaco humiliated as PSG clinch Ligue1 title with five-goal rout

The biggest match in French football this season ended in a PSG steamroller, as Monaco were crushed 5-0 to see their Ligue 1 title dreams go up in smoke.

Edinson Cavani and Neymar both scored twice, with the Brazilian superstar now having 27 goals in all competitions this season.

"I'm very happy to have won this trophy," Cavani told Canal+. "The team helped me a lot and I thank them for that. We're all very happy."

"Monaco are a great side but we played at our best and deserved to win," added Neymar. "We wanted to win this title for the fans and we've done it."

PSG started with plenty of intent and it was no surprise when they took the lead after 10 minutes. Neymar's corner was only partially cleared and Cavani was on hand to volley home from close range.

The floodgates could have opened, but Monaco were given a lifeline moments later when Kylian Mbappe was fouled in the area by Dani Alves. Radamel Falcao stepped up but his spot-kick was brilliantly saved by Alphonse Areola.

However, Monaco's respite was short-lived as PSG doubled their lead just before the break. Neymar led a counter-attack before picking out Cavani, who finished clinically past Danijel Subasic.

Any hopes Monaco had of staging a comeback were effectively extinguished early in the second half as PSG made it 3-0. Neymar turned provider again as he found Mbappe inside the area, and the 18-year-old finished coolly into the bottom corner.

Neymar then got his second of the game, slotting home from an angle after being teed up by Marco Verratti. And there was still time for Cavani to get his second of the night, converting from close range after good work from Julian Draxler down the left wing

#  Ligue1 crown secured in style as PSG put five past Monaco

 Paris Saint-Germain secured their sixth Ligue1 title in seven years on Sunday as they put five past Monaco at the Parc des Princes.

Goals from Angel Di Maria, Kylian Mbappe and Neymar – who also added a brace – saw the champions run out comfortable winners, with Monaco producing a disappointing performance in what may well have been their last game under Leonardo Jardim.

The result moves PSG to 82 points for the season, 13 clear of second-placed Lille, who have just two games remaining.

It was a fitting way for Neymar to mark his 27th birthday, with the Brazilian having enjoyed another stellar season in France; one which has seen him score 29 goals and provide 19 assists in just 30 appearances.

“Neymar is someone very special and he’s always shown that since he joined us. He loves Paris and he loves being here,” PSG boss Thomas Tuchel said after the game.

“He’s happy and relaxed and he knows that it’s only thanks to him that we can achieve big things. I don’t think there are any doubts that Neymar wants to stay here – he has already shown that this year. He is still young and has room for improvement, which is scary for opponents. He delivered again today when it mattered most.”
