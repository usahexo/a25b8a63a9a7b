#  Cedevita Olimpija Gears Up For Gus Hansen's Annual Casino Night Gambling Tournament In Tahoe, CA

Gus Hansen is a professional poker player who rose to fame in the early 2000s. He has won three World Series of Poker bracelets and was one of the biggest stars on the professional poker circuit. These days, Hansen is just as well-known for his high-stakes gambling exploits as he is for his poker skills.

One of Hansen's most famous gambles took place in 2014, when he traveled to Tahoe, CA for what's known as "Gus Hansen's Annual Casino Night Gambling Tournament." This tournament attracts some of the world's best gamblers, and Hansen was eager to test his skills against the best of the best.

The tournament didn't go quite as well as Hansen had hoped. He finished in last place, losing a whopping $1.5 million in the process. Undeterred, Hansen is returning to Tahoe later this year for another go at the title.

This time around, Hansen will have some stiff competition. The field is likely to be led by Phil Ivey and Antonio Esfandiari, both of whom are considered to be among the best all-round gamblers in the world.

For Cedevita Olimpija CEO Earl Woods Jr., this tournament is a chance to put his team on the map. "We're excited to compete against some of the top players in the world," said Woods Jr. "This is a great opportunity for our team to show what they can do."

The Cedevita Olimpija roster is stacked with some of Europe's finest talent, including Dario Saric and Luka Doncic. With Ivey and Esfandiari among their opponents, they'll need every bit of that talent if they hope to come out on top.
