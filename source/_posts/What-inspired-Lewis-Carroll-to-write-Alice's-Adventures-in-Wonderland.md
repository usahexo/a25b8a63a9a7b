#  What inspired Lewis Carroll to write Alice's Adventures in Wonderland?

There is no one definitive answer to this question; it is likely that a variety of factors influenced Lewis Carroll to write Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. One possible influence may have been the political climate during Carroll's time. In addition to writing children's stories, Carroll was also a mathematician and logician, and he may have been inspired to write Alice's Adventures in Wonderland as a way to satirize the contemporary political scene.

Another possible influence on Carroll's writing may have been his own life experiences. As a child, Carroll was often ill and spent a great deal of time alone reading and exploring his imagination. This may have led him to create the story of Alice, who is also very imaginative and explores a fantastical world.

Whatever the specific reasons were for Carroll's inspiration, it is clear that Alice's Adventures in Wonderland has had a lasting impact on both children and adults all over the world.
