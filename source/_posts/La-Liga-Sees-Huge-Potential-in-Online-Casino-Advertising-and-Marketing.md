#  La Liga Sees Huge Potential in Online Casino Advertising and Marketing

Spain’s top football league, La Liga, has seen a great potential in online casino advertising and marketing. The Spanish Football League (LFP) has announced a partnership with the Malta-based BetGenius platform to provide information on players and matches to help casinos make informed decisions on where to place their bets.

According to LFP president Javier Tebas, the new agreement will “improve the knowledge of La Liga and its clubs, as well as help BetGenius offer an even better betting experience to its customers.” He went on to say that the deal is a “major step forward for both La Liga and the betting industry.”

The new agreement will give BetGenius access to detailed data about teams and players, including match statistics, player performance stats, as well as injury reports. This information will help casinos make better predictions about how games will play out, which in turn should lead to more accurate bets being placed.

This is not the first time that La Liga has partnered with an online casino company. In 2016, the league partnered with Gaming Innovation Group (GIG), which operates several online casinos including Rizk, Guts, Betspin, and Thrills. As part of that deal, GIG became an official betting partner of La Liga, and was given access to exclusive content and marketing opportunities.

The deal with BetGenius is expected to be just as beneficial for both parties involved. For La Liga, it provides a new source of revenue that can be used to help offset some of the high costs associated with running a top-level football league. And for BetGenius, it gives them access to high-quality data that can be used to improve their betting products and services.

#  La Liga Strives to Remain at the Top of the Gaming Industry

The Spanish La Liga has been a dominant presence in the global gaming industry for years. With some of the most popular and well-respected teams in the world, La Liga has catered to gamers of all levels of experience and interest.

The current gaming market is estimated to be worth over $109 billion, and La Liga is doing everything it can to ensure that it remains a top player in the space. The league has made a number of strategic partnerships with gaming companies, developed new video games, and created an e-sports division.

2012 saw the launch of La Liga Gaming, the league’s first official video game. Developed by Spanish company Bitcomposer Games, the game featured all 20 teams from Spain’s top flight football league. It was available for PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 platforms.

In March 2017, La Liga announced a new strategic alliance with French video game developer Bigben Interactive. As part of the deal, Bigben Interactive would develop new video games featuring La Liga content, as well as create an e-sports division for the league.

"This agreement allows us to offer our millions of fans around the world an even more immersive experience with their favourite teams and players," said La Liga president Javier Tebas. "Furthermore, it represents an important step forward in our international growth strategy."

The first fruit of this alliance bore fruit in January 2018 with the release of “FIFA 18: El Clásico Edition”. The game featured bonus content such as exclusive kits and players from both Real Madrid and Barcelona. It was released on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

La Liga isn’t just relying on traditional video games to stay competitive in the gaming industry; it is also getting into e-sports betting in a big way. In October 2017, La Liga partnered with Sportradar to create an e-sports betting platform for its 19th season. The platform would offer bettors odds on matches played by professional gamers across a variety of different games.

"This new venture confirms our commitment to innovation and our aim to become leaders in digital entertainment," said Tebas at the time of the announcement. "E-sports are enjoying spectacular growth and we want our fans to enjoy all aspects of the sport."

#  Spanish Teams Lead the Way in Casino Advertising

Spain’s top teams are commanding the largest share of casino advertising investment in Europe. Figures released by research company Nielsen Sports show that La Liga sides Real Madrid and Barcelona took the top two spots, with a combined total of €35m being invested in advertising by casinos last season.

This puts them well ahead of Premier League clubs Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool, who rank third, fourth and fifth respectively with a total advertising spend of €25m. The latest figures suggest that Spanish clubs are increasingly seen as a key target market for casino brands.

The growth in casino advertising is being driven by the increasing popularity of online betting, which now accounts for almost a third of all sports betting turnover in Europe. This has led to a rise in the number of casinos targeting consumers through sponsorship deals with football clubs and other sports teams.

Casinos are attracted to the large numbers of passionate fans that European football teams enjoy, as well as the potential to reach new customers through televised broadcasts and social media platforms. Sponsorship deals also provide an opportunity for casinos to associate themselves with high-profile brands and create positive PR messages.

Real Madrid secured the biggest deal in European football this year when they signed an agreement with casino operator Bodog to become their official global partner. As part of the deal, Bodog will have exclusive branding rights at the Bernabéu Stadium and will be able to use Real Madrid’s players and trademarks in their marketing campaigns.

Bodog isn’t alone in targeting Spanish clubs; other leading casino operators such as William Hill, Ladbrokes and 888 have also invested heavily in advertising partnerships with La Liga sides. This is likely to continue given the current trend for online betting, which is forecast to grow at an annual rate of 7% over the next five years.

#  Gambling Operators eye Upcoming La Liga Season

As the new La Liga football season edges nearer, Spain’s top gambling operators are eyeing up lucrative sponsorship deals with some of the league’s biggest teams.

According to a report in Spanish sports daily Marca, both Bet365 and bwin are said to be in discussion with a number of clubs about sponsoring the upcoming season.

Bet365 is said to be close to securing a deal with Real Madrid, while bwin is lined up to become the new main sponsor of Atletico Madrid.

Both companies are keen to increase their exposure in Spain, where football is hugely popular. La Liga is watched by millions of fans every week and is one of the most-watched leagues in the world.

The move by Bet365 and bwin comes after Ladbrokes pulled out of Spain’s top football division last year. The UK bookmaker had been a main sponsor of Sevilla FC for six years, but chose not to renew its deal last summer.

There has been a flurry of activity in the Spanish sponsorship market over the past year or so, with many of the top betting firms looking to increase their presence in the country.

Last September, William Hill announced that it was becoming the new main sponsor of Valencia CF, while rival operator 888 Holdings agreed a deal with Villarreal CF.

#  La Liga Looks to Capitalize on International Audience

The Spanish football league, La Liga, is looking to expand its reach to international audiences. The league is working to improve its online presence in order to make it easier for fans around the world to follow their favorite teams.

One of the ways La Liga plans to do this is by streaming matches live on social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube. Additionally, the league plans to launch a new website that will be available in multiple languages.

La Liga also plans to increase its marketing efforts in key markets like Asia and North America. This includes establishing new partnerships with TV networks and increasing attendance at fan events.

Ultimately, La Liga hopes to build on its strong international following and create even more interest in Spanish football around the world.
