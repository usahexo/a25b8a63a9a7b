#  Teenager gambles away college fund in Las Vegas casino

Las Vegas – A local teenager is in trouble after gambling away his college fund at a Las Vegas casino.

The 18-year-old had saved up the money for several years in preparation for his freshman year of college, but lost it all in a single night at a blackjack table.

He now says he plans to ask his parents for forgiveness and hope they will still be able to afford to send him to school.

Local police say the young man is not likely to face any criminal charges, as gambling is not illegal in Nevada.

#  Parents of underage gambling victim speak out

In a society where gambling is often seen as a fun and harmless pastime, the parents of an underage gambling victim are speaking out about the devastation their son’s addiction has caused.

The young man, who is in his early twenties, first started gambling when he was just 16. His parents thought it was just a phase, but soon they realized that their son had a serious problem.

Gambling quickly became his main source of entertainment and his life began to unravel. He started skipping school, lying to them and stealing money from them in order to feed his addiction.

The final straw came when he blew all of the family’s savings on online gambling. His parents had to take out a loan to pay off his debts and they were so embarrassed that they didn’t want anyone to know what had happened.

They feel like they failed their son and they are angry that the casinos allowed him to gamble underage. They hope that by sharing their story, they can help other families who might be going through the same thing.

#  Would-be gambler under 21 caught, loses $1,500

An 18-year-old college student who was caught gambling by casino security staff at the Meadows Racetrack and Casino in Washington County, Pennsylvania, last week will now have to pay a $1,500 fine.

The young man had reportedly been gambling at the slots for around two hours when he was caught. According to surveillance footage, the would-be gambler had managed to lose a total of $1,500.

Casino security staff turned the teenager over to police, who cited him for underage gambling. He will now have to pay a $1,500 fine as well as court costs.

This is not the first time that underage gamblers have been caught in Pennsylvania casinos. In 2013, two 19-year-olds were caught gambling at Mohegan Sun Pocono and were each fined $2,000.

Underage gambling is a crime in Pennsylvania, and it can result in fines up to $5,000 as well as possible imprisonment. The law applies to anyone under 21 years of age who gambles in a casino or other commercial gaming establishment.

It is not only minors who can be penalized for underage gambling; parents or guardians can also be held responsible if they allow their children to gamble. In fact, in 2012 a parent was fined $5,000 for permitting her 15-year-old son to gamble at an Atlantic City casino.

So far this year, there have been a number of arrests of underage gamblers in Pennsylvania casinos. In February, security staff at Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem arrested an 18-year-old woman for allegedly trying to use a fake ID to gamble; she was later charged with identity theft and perjury. In March, three 19-year-olds were arrested for underage gambling at Parx Casino in Bensalem Township. They were each fined $500.

Pennsylvania is one of a number of states that have laws prohibiting minors from gambling in casinos and other gaming establishments. In most cases the penalties are relatively minor – fines and/or jail time of less than six months – but recent cases suggest that authorities are starting to take this issue more seriously.

#  Casino gaming industry called to task on underage gambling

The casino gaming industry is coming under fire this week by regulatory bodies in the United States and Canada for their lack of policing when it comes to underage gambling. The industry has been lax in enforcing rules that would keep minors from gambling, and as a result, both the U.S. and Canadian governments are considering new regulations that would hold the casinos more accountable.

In the U.S., the National Gambling Impact Study Commission released a report this week calling on the casino gaming industry to do more to prevent underage gambling. The report found that while casinos currently have procedures in place to check IDs and ensure that no one under 21 is gambling, these procedures are not always followed. And even when they are followed, there is no way to know how many minors are getting around the system.

As a result, the commission is recommending that casinos be required to use more sophisticated ID checking technology, such as chips embedded in ID cards that can be read by scanners. The commission is also recommending that casinos be fined or closed down if they are caught allowing minors to gamble.

In Canada, the government is also considering new regulations aimed at the casino gaming industry. A bill currently before parliament would require casinos to check IDs for all players, regardless of age, and would levy fines of up to $100,000 against casinos caught allowing minors to gamble.

#  Underage gamble leads to eviction from casino

In a recent incident, an underage gambler was removed from a casino in Sydney for violating the casino’s terms and conditions. The incident highlights the importance of casinos being able to enforce their terms and conditions when it comes to gambling by minors.

The incident occurred when the 18-year-old tried to gamble at the Star Casino in Sydney. Casino staff quickly identified that the individual was underage and escorted them from the premises. A spokesperson for the casino said that “the safety and security of our guests is our number one priority and those who breach our terms and conditions will be removed from the property”.

This is not the first time that an underage gambler has been removed from a casino. Earlier this year, two teenagers were removed from Crown Perth for trying to gamble with fake ID cards. In another high-profile case, billionaire gaming mogul James Packer was forced to temporarily close his casino in Sri Lanka after a group of underage schoolgirls were caught gambling there.

So why are casinos so strict about enforcing their age requirements? The answer is simple - because gambling can be incredibly addictive and damaging for minors. Studies have shown that children who start gambling at a young age are more likely to develop problems with addiction as adults. They are also more likely to experience financial difficulties and mental health problems.

This is why casinos have a responsibility to protect minors from gambling addiction by enforcing their age restrictions. It is also why parents need to be aware of the dangers of underage gambling and talk to their children about it. If you are worried that your child may be addicted to gambling, there are signs you can look out for, including increased secrecy, lying or stealing money, and mood swings or changes in behaviour.

If you think your child may have a problem with gambling, it is important to seek help as soon as possible. There are many organisations that can provide support, including Gambling Help Online (www.gamblinghelponline.org), Gamblers Anonymous (www.gamblersanonymous.org), and Problem Gambling Foundation (www.problemgambling.org).
