#  Mississippi Riverboat Casino Introduces Minimum Age Requirement of 21 for Gambling

In a move that is sure to frustrate many young adults, the Mississippi Riverboat Casino has announced that it will be instituting a new minimum age requirement of 21 for gambling.

The decision was made in response to what casino officials call "the growing epidemic of problem gambling among young people." In a statement, the casino said that it hoped the new rule would help to protect "vulnerable populations" and prevent them from developing gambling addictions.

The announcement has been met with mixed reactions from the public. Some people say that it is unfair to prohibit young adults from enjoying one of the many legal forms of entertainment available to them. Others argue that it is irresponsible for casinos to allow minors to gamble, especially when so many are already struggling with addiction.

At this time, it is unclear whether or not other casinos in the area will follow suit.

#  Mississippi Riverboat Casino Implements Minimum Age Requirement of 21 for Gambling

In response to recent concerns over problem gambling, the management of the Mississippi Riverboat Casino has announced a new policy requiring all patrons to be at least 21 years old in order to gamble.

The new age requirement will take effect starting on Friday, September 1st. "After careful consideration, we believe that this is a necessary step to help protect our guests and our business," said casino spokesperson Tammy Price.

Some people are unhappy with the decision, including local resident Jesse Jackson Jr., who criticized it as "discriminatory." Others argue that it's simply an effort to reduce gambling-related problems.

According to Price, the casino already has a number of measures in place to prevent excessive gambling, such as limits on the amount that can be wagered and time restrictions on playing. "But at the end of the day, we need to do what's best for our guests and our business," she said.

#  Minimum Age for Gambling at Mississippi Riverboat Casino Increased to 21

The minimum age for gambling at a Mississippi Riverboat Casino has been increased from 18 to 21. The change went into effect on January 1, 2018 and will impact both land-based and floating casinos in the state.

According to Mississippi state law, those under 21 are not allowed to gamble in any capacity, whether that be by playing slot machines, table games or participating in poker tournaments. The only exception is if someone is accompanying a parent or legal guardian who is gambling at the casino.

Mississippi isn’t the only state with a minimum gambling age of 21. In Nevada, New Jersey and Oregon - all of which have legalized casino gambling - the minimum age is also 21. Some states, such as Maine and Michigan, have a minimum age of 18 for casino gambling, while others don’t have any minimum age requirement at all.

The new age restriction in Mississippi comes as no surprise to casino operators in the state. In recent years they have seen an uptick in patrons who are under the legal gambling age and they’ve been vocal about their desire to see this changed. Johnna joiner, communications director for Fitzgeralds Casino Tunica, said that while they understand that 18-year-olds are adults in many respects, “gambling is a different activity altogether” and that it can be harmful for people that young to start gambling.

Some people in the state are opposed to raising the minimum age for gambling. They contend that it will simply push underage gamblers underground where they will be more prone to participate in illegal activities such as card counting or cheating. Others argue that if someone is old enough to vote or serve in the military then they should be allowed to gamble at a casino.

#  New Mississippi Riverboat Casino Raises Minimum Age for Gambling to 21

The new Mississippi Riverboat Casino has announced that it will be raising the minimum age for gambling from 18 to 21.

“We want to ensure that all our guests have a safe and enjoyable experience when they visit our casino,” said a spokesperson for the casino. “That means we need to raise the minimum age for gambling so that only those who are legally able to gamble can do so.”

The change is expected to go into effect on September 1st.

#  Mississippi Riverboat Casino Requires Minimum Age of 21 to Gamble

The Mississippi Riverboat Casino announces that as of March 1, 2019, it will require all players to be at least 21 years old in order to gamble on its premises. This new policy is being put into place in order to better protect players and ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for all guests.

Mississippi Riverboat Casino Director of Marketing Walter Walton released a statement about the decision: "We are committed to providing a fun, safe, and responsible environment for all of our guests. We believe that this change will help us accomplish that goal by limiting access to those who are of legal gambling age."

The new policy has already sparked some controversy, with some people arguing that it is unfair to younger adults who want to gamble. However, the casino's management feels that this is the best course of action in order to protect its customers.

Those who are under 21 are still welcome to visit the casino, but they will not be able to gamble. There are a number of other activities available at the casino for those who are younger, including restaurants, concerts, and shopping.
