Here is a guide on how to play the most popular games legally, with friends.</p>
<h2 id="Roulette"><a href="#Roulette" class="headerlink" title="Roulette"></a>Roulette</h2><p>Roulette is one of the easiest casino games to learn and play. The game is played with a spinning roulette wheel and a ball that decides the winning number. Place your bets by placing chips on the table layout. After the bets are made, the dealer will release the ball and it will fall into one of 36 numbered slots on the wheel. If your bet covers the number where the ball lands, you win!</p>
<p>There are many betting options available in roulette, so make sure to familiarize yourself with all of them before playing. The standard inside bets are: red or black, odd or even, low (1-18) or high (19-36). You can also bet on specific numbers (called straight up bets), pairs of numbers, three numbers (street bets), four numbers (corner bets) or six numbers (double street bets). For more complex betting strategies, check out this guide [1].</p>
<p>To play roulette with friends, each player needs to chip in an equal amount for the pot. The dealer then spins the wheel and releases the ball. Players can place their bets until the dealer calls “No More Bets”. The winner is determined when the ball comes to rest in a numbered slot and players collect their winnings based on their bets.</p>
<h2 id="Blackjack"><a href="#Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack"></a>Blackjack</h2><p>Blackjack is another popular casino game that is easy to learn and play. The objective of blackjack is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over. The game is played with two cards dealt face down to each player and one face up card dealt to the dealer. Players must decide whether to hit (draw another card), stand (take no more cards), double down (double their bet and receive one more card), split (split a hand of two cards of equal value into two separate hands) or surrender (give up half their bet and end the hand).</p>
<p>To play blackjack with friends, each player needs to chip in an equal amount for the pot. The dealer then deals two cards face down to each player and one face up card dealt face up card to himself/herself. Players must decide what action they want to take for their first hand. Once all players have finished their first hand, those who still have cards remaining in their hand must again choose an action for their second hand. After all players have finished both hands, those who still have cards remaining in their hand lose automatically - even if they have not gone over 21! The winner is determined by whoever has closest total without going over 21 - including any bonuses for being first person out of cards). Players collect their chips based on their final position at the end of the game.</p>
<h2 id="Poker"><a href="#Poker" class="headerlink" title="Poker"></a>Poker</h2><p>Poker is a popular gambling game that involves bluffing and strategy. The aim of poker is to win as many chips as possible by either winning individual hands or taking advantage of other players’ mistakes. There are many variants of poker, but Five Card Draw is a good starter variant that can be easily understood by beginners [2]. In Five Card Draw, players are dealt five cards each which they must use either individually or in combination with others held in their hand to make the best possible five-card poker hand. Betting rounds take place after each player has been dealt five cards, with players either folding (losing all chips they’ve put into play thus far), calling (matching the current bet), raising (betting more than what’s been put forward so far) or checking (not putting in any money but allowing actions from those who have). Play then proceeds clockwise around table until all active players have either folded or put in money for subsequent rounds; at which point remaining active players show their hands and winner takes entire pot - minus a small cut taken by dealer/house). </p>
<p>To play poker with friends, each player needs to chip in an equal amount for ante - usually around $5-$10 per person depending on stakes desired/agreed upon beforehand). Dealer then deals out five cards face down for each player; after everyone has looked at their cards they simultaneously discard any unwanted ones and replace them from deck using replacement procedure prescribed by house rules(<em>see below</em>). Dealer then sets deck away, collects discarded cards and places them under his/her stack of chips; shuffling remainder of deck thoroughly before beginning next round - remembering which player had which discarded card(s)). Play now proceeds according its normal course: betting rounds followed by showdown between active players if necessary etcetera until either everyone else has folded OR there’s only one person left standing holding better Poker Hand than anyone else at table; In which case said individual scoopst up pot uncontested &amp; ends current game proceedings amicably thereby</p>
